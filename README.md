# 🎬 IMDb Top Movies Analysis

### A Data Visualization & Insights Project

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the IMDb Top Movies dataset to understand movie trends based on different factors such as:

* Movie ratings
* Duration (short, medium, long)
* Certificate / Age rating
* Genres
* Release decade
* Rating categories (Excellent, Very Good, Outstanding)
* Word cloud analysis of movie descriptions

Several visualizations were created using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, including:

* Pie charts
* Scatter plots
* Line charts
* Bar charts
* Word clouds
* Multivariate visualizations

The main goal is to identify hidden patterns and relationships between movie features such as duration and ratings, certificate vs decade, rating category trends, etc.
